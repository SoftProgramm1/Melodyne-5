### New features and improvements

Surround: In both ARA and Transfer modes, Melodyne can now also be used for the editing of tracks in the standard surround formats.
ARA in Pro Tools: Melodyne 5.3 comes with all the technical prerequisites for ARA integration into Pro Tools from Version 2022.09 upwards and thus makes a significantly improved workflow in Pro Tools possible.
Preferences: When Melodyne is employed for the first time as a plug-in, it loads the set of keyboard shortcuts corresponding to the DAW you are using.

### Bug fixes

Recording: In the stand-alone implementation of Melodyne, you can now also use a recording device with a mono input (e.g. a MacBook microphone).
ARA in Cubase: When moving an ARA event to a track that is not selected, the selection in Melodyne is now retained.
Pro Tools: The position of the playback cursor in Melodyne is now correctly updated even when playback is stopped.
AAX in Pro Tools: When bouncing/committing, Melodyne now correctly evaluates the offline setting.
The Correct Pitch macro: When the macro was applied to a very large number of notes simultaneously, Melodyne would sometimes freeze. This no longer happens.
Preferences: Previously, in ARA mode, the keyboard shortcut for “Playback Selection” was erroneously listed under “Others” instead of under “Transport Bar”. This has been fixed.
The Note Inspector: The input field for Sibilant Balance now reliably accepts input even when multiple tracks are being edited simultaneously.
ARA in Cakewalk by Bandlab: Under certain circumstances, Melodyne would crash when loading a session. This has been fixed.
Ableton Live: The cause of random crashes when Melodyne was running in Live 11.1.1 under macOS Monterey on a Mac with an M1 chip has been detected and eliminated.
Note editing: The “Restore Original” commands in the Edit menu now behave more consistently in the stand-alone implementation, in the Transfer plug-in and under ARA.
